    <p>Observations: 
        1. In reviewing the data for timepoints for all mice in this study by drug regimen, it becomes apparent that most treatments have more than 150 time points, with the exception of Propriva which had approximately only 150 time points. This may be due to a lack of reduction of Tumor Volume, an overgrowth of Tumor Volume, or no change seen at all. The two treatments that had the highest number of time points were Capomullin and Ramicane, which both had over 200 time points for the mice treated. This may indicate an observation of Tumor Volume reduction seen in both treatments. 
        
        2. In reviewing the boxplot data for the final tumor volume of each mouse across four of the treatment regimens Capomulin, Ceftamin, Infubinol and Ramicane, at the last time point for each treatment Ceftamin and Infubinol had the highest upper bounds and lower bounds for tumor volume. Infubinol had one outlier below its lower bound quartile. However, Capomulin and Ramicane had the lowest tumor volumes at the last time point. In reviewing the total timepoints per data and drug regimen for all mice, both Capomulin and Ramicane contained more time points, which brings a stronger case that both of these treatments positively impacted the reduction of Tumor Volume per MM3. 
        
        3. In reviewing the individual data for Mouse X401, who was treated with Capomulin as the number of times points increased the Tumor Volume decreased from being over 45.0MM3 to under 30.0MM3.  At first glance, it seems that Capomulin is a protective measure for tumor reduction in mice.  </p>
